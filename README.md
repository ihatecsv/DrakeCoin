DrakeCoin is my attempt at writing a cryptocurrency from the ground up.

A blog post on the project can be found [here](https://drakeluce.com/blog/?p=126)!

#### Disclaimer
* This should not be used as a reference for writing your own cryptocurrency, I can't guarantee the validity of my code.
* This is not really as modular or neat as it should be; I intend on rewriting this project from scratch!
