# DrakeCoin

DrakeCoin is totally not a real cryptocurrency, and is basically just me learning about blockchains and cryptographic consensus.

#### Disclaimer
* I don't really know much about cryptocurrency at the time of writing this software. This should not be used as a reference because I guarantee there's something wrong with it cryptographically.
* I know that Node.js is certainly not an ideal platform to implement a cryptocurrency on. If I ever decide to make a real cryptocurrency, I will certainly choose a different platform. But, for the time being, I am comfortable learning new things in Node.js. That being said, please let me know if you have any suggestions!
